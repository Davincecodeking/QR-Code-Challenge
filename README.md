## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Angular.js](https://angular.io/) - Angular framework



### What I learned

One major learning core for me is learning how to work with external fonts e.g. Google fonts 
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
 {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: "Outfit", "Helvetica", "sans-serif";
}
```


### Continued development

Areas I will like to focus more in future projects includes the followings: 

CSS Grid: Deepen understanding of CSS Grid for creating complex, responsive layouts. Experiment with grid template areas, implicit and explicit grid tracks, and responsive design patterns.

Flexbox: Refine skills with Flexbox, focusing on alignment, distribution, and responsive layouts. Practice handling edge cases and nested flex containers.

Master the use of media queries to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
